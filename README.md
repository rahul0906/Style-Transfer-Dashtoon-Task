# Style-Transfer
## This Repo Exists as a proof of assignment solution for Dashtoon by Rahul Sawant.

### I have proposed two solutions:
### 1. Self Supervised: Neural Artistic Transfer ([Research Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04058#:~:text=The%20seminal%20work%20of%20Gatys%20et%20al.%20demonstrated,is%20referred%20to%20as%20Neural%20Style%20Transfer%20%28NST%29.))
### 2. CycleGAN based Model ([Research paper](https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/ipr2.12342))

### Note : Due to ongoing placement tests which consume most of our time, it was very difficult to give time to the assignment. So this is my best effort keeping time limitations in mind.
